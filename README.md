# Tic Tac Toe


# Description 

This python project utilizes functions, conditional statements, a list, and a while loop to make a fully functional tic tac toe game. The program can determine when there is a winner and when there is a draw. 


# Language and Utilities Used

- Python 3.10.11
- Thonny 4.1.3


# Environments Used 

- Windows 11


# Notes

The program does not validate user input. When time permits, this program will be updated to fix that issue with the help of a dedicated validation function.
